# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of mapping these earthquakes is to show the difference between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Overview 
For this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and we retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then, we added the data to a map. 
We used the JavaScript and D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then, using the Leaflet library, we plotted the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
